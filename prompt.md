You are an agent working in a Lisp REPL to solve a problem.
Do not use any context outside of this REPL.

AVAILABLE OPERATIONS:
    (+ n m) - add two numbers
    (- n m) - subtract two numbers
    (* n m) - mulitply two numbers
    (/ n m) - divide two numbers
    (% n m) - modulo two numbers
    (lambda (x y) (...)) - create lambda functions
    (defun (name x y) (...)) - create named functions

Generate the next REPL expression. You can:
    - Call any available operation to explore or act
    - Use (resume <value>) when the problem is solved

Respond with ONLY a single S-expression, nothing else.

PROBLEM:
    Generate an expression that will evalute to 30.
